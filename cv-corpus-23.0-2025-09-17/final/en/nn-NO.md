# *Norsk Nynorsk* &mdash; Norwegian Nynorsk (`nn-NO`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Norwegian Nynorsk (`nn-NO`).

## Language

Norwegian Nynorsk is a written standard of Norwegian. The standard is the preferred written 
standard of around 10-15% of the Norwegian population and is largely based on the Norwegian dialects
of the West of Norway.

The language code is `nn` and the locale is `nn-NO` (Nynorsk as written in Norway). Note that this 
locale includes the region code for historical reasons relating to the localisation platform. The dataset
contains Norwegian as spoken anywhere and as written in the Nynorsk standard.

Dette med følg boka skjønte eg heller ikkje heilt vitsen med.
Eg har ikkje mykje om kap.
Ei rettssak er i grunnen ein fin måte å stille ting i relieff på.
Kva er forklaringa på at regjeringa enno ikkje har følgt dette opp?
Eg gler meg også til å lesa.

### Sources

* [Korpus med bokomtalar frå Bokelskere.no](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-53/) (Public domain)
* [Stortingskorpuset 1.1](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-58/) (Public domain)
* Individual sentences submitted by users through the Mozilla Common Voice interface (Public domain)

### Text domains

The corpus was initially seeded with sentences from
* Book reviews and book discussions (from the web community bokelskere.no)
* Transcribed and manually checked discussions from the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), from 2017 to 2018

Later, several individual users have contributed sentences in various
domains through Mozilla's web interface.

### Processing

Both sources include sentences in both Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmål.

Norwegian Nynorsk candidate sentences were extracted by both excluding Bokmål-only words and including 
Nynorsk-only words:

| Only       | Words   |
|------------|------------|
| Bokmål |  *ikke*, *jeg*, *en*, *et*, *fra*, *hun*, *noen*, *være*, *mer*, *ble*, *mye*, *bare*, *boken*, *kommer*, *flere*, *dem*  |
| Nynorsk |  *eg*, *ikkje*, *ein*, *me*, *vere*, *meir*, *fleire*, *berre*, *ho*, *eit*, *blei*, *vart*  | 

These candidate sentences were then checked by two writers of Nynorsk to ensure that they were indeed written
in Nynorsk before inclusion into the corpus.
