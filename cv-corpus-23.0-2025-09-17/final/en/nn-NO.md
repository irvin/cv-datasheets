# *Norsk Nynorsk* &mdash; Norwegian Nynorsk (`nn-NO`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset

standard of around 10-15% of the Norwegian population and is largely based on the Norwegian dialects
of the West of Norway.

The language code is `nn` and the locale is `nn-NO` (Nynorsk as written in Norway). Note that this 
locale includes the region code for historical reasons relating to the localisation platform. The dataset

```
Dette med følg boka skjønte eg heller ikkje heilt vitsen med.
Eg har ikkje mykje om kap.
Ei rettssak er i grunnen ein fin måte å stille ting i relieff på.
Kva er forklaringa på at regjeringa enno ikkje har følgt dette opp?
Eg gler meg også til å lesa.

* [Korpus med bokomtalar frå Bokelskere.no](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/resource-catalogue/oai-nb-no-sbr-53/) (Public domain)
* [Stortingskorpuset 1.1](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-58/) (Public domain)
* Individual sentences submitted by users through the Mozilla Common Voice interface (Public domain)

### Text domains

The corpus was initially seeded with sentences from
* Book reviews and book discussions (from the web community bokelskere.no)
* Transcribed and manually checked discussions from the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget), from 2017 to 2018

Later, several individual users have contributed sentences in various
domains through Mozilla's web interface.

### Processing

Both sources include sentences in both Norwegian Nynorsk and Norwegian Bokmål.

Norwegian Nynorsk candidate sentences were extracted by both excluding Bokmål-only words and including 
Nynorsk-only words:

| Only       | Words   |
|------------|------------|
| Bokmål |  *ikke*, *jeg*, *en*, *et*, *fra*, *hun*, *noen*, *være*, *mer*, *ble*, *mye*, *bare*, *boken*, *kommer*, *flere*, *dem*  |
| Nynorsk |  *eg*, *ikkje*, *ein*, *me*, *vere*, *meir*, *fleire*, *berre*, *ho*, *eit*, *blei*, *vart*  | 

These candidate sentences were then checked by two writers of Nynorsk to ensure that they were indeed written
in Nynorsk before inclusion into the corpus.
